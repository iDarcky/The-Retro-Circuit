## [ 00 ] // THE MISSION
We are the archivists of the silicon age.
The Retro Circuit is not just a website; it is a digital preservation effort for the artifacts that defined our childhoods and the machines that are defining our future.

We believe that **Hardware is Art**.
The click of a micro-switch, the scanlines of a passive-matrix LCD, the transparency of Atomic Purple plastic—these are not just specs. They are cultural touchstones.

## [ 01 ] // THE AESTHETIC
Our visual language is **High-Tech Nostalgia**.
- We embrace the **Cyberpunk** ethos: High tech, low life, neon lights, and terminal screens.
- We honor the **Pixel**: The fundamental atom of our digital universe.
- We speak **Terminal**: `>_` is our native tongue.

## [ 02 ] // THE CODE
We reject bloat. We reject opacity.
- **Truth in Data:** We do not guess. If a device has 512MB of RAM, we document it. If it runs PS2 at 15fps, we say "Unplayable". We do not sugarcoat performance for hype.
- **Open Architecture:** Our systems are built to be explored, compared, and analyzed.

## [ 03 ] // THE USER
You are the **Operator**.
Whether you are a veteran of the Console Wars of the 90s or a new recruit in the Handheld PC revolution, you have a place here.
- **Respect the Past:** A Game Boy DMG is as important as a Steam Deck.
- **Embrace the Future:** We are always looking for the next leap in portable computation.

## [ 04 ] // SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
**PRESERVE. COMPARE. PLAY.**
The backlog is infinite. The battery life is finite.
Make every pixel count.
