# Partner Kit: The Retro Circuit

## 1. Executive Summary
**The Retro Circuit** is the definitive digital archive and comparison engine for handheld gaming history. We bridge the gap between nostalgia and modern tech, providing a centralized platform for enthusiasts to discover, compare, and track the evolution of portable gaming—from the 1989 Game Boy to the latest high-performance PC handhelds like the Steam Deck.

## 2. The Problem
- **Fragmented Information:** Specs, release dates, and emulation performance are scattered across wikis, YouTube videos, and forum threads.
- **Confusion in the Market:** With the explosion of Chinese retro handhelds (Anbernic, Miyoo, Retroid), consumers are overwhelmed by choices and naming conventions.
- **Lack of Verification:** "Can it run PS2?" is the #1 question, and answers are often anecdotal or unreliable.

## 3. Our Solution
A unified, data-driven platform that treats handheld consoles with the same rigor as modern smartphone reviews, wrapped in an engaging, gamified interface.

### Core Value Propositions
- **For Gamers:** Find the perfect device for your budget and specific nostalgia needs (e.g., "Best device under $100 for GameCube").
- **For Collectors:** Track your collection ('Own' vs 'Want') and visualize your hardware library.
